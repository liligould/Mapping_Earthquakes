# Mapping_Earthquakes

Via JavaScript's GeoJSON, the purpose of this analysis was to enhance data visualization skills by creating an interactive map that can identify earthquakes all around the world. By using GeoJSON data from the USGS website, geographical coordinates and the magnitude of each earthquake were retrieved within the last week. By adding layers the visualization depicts the type of map to view in, the radius of the points based on earthquake magnitude, and popups attached to each point as to see the direct location and magnitude. The final results also include tectonic plate data as well as major earthquakes.
